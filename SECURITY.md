# Security Policy

## Reporting a vulnerability

**Do not open a public issue.** Report privately via
[GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/egemenyildiz/herdr-slack/security/advisories/new).

Expect an acknowledgement within a few days. This is a small project — if a fix is going to take a
while, you'll be told that rather than left waiting.

## What this tool actually does

Read this before installing it. herdr-slack lets messages in Slack **type into terminals on your
machine**, so Slack access is terminal access. Two distinct risks:

### 1. Who can act

Anyone able to act through the bot can run commands as you. Mitigations, all on by default:

- **Allowlist is mandatory.** The daemon refuses to start with an empty `allowedUsers`.
- **Team pinning.** Payloads whose `team_id` doesn't match the workspace you set up are rejected.
- **DM-only.** Conversations outside a DM are refused; there is no channel-feed path.
- **Opaque refs.** Interactive payloads carry a random reference resolved server-side; a crafted
  payload cannot name an arbitrary pane. Unknown or dead refs fail closed.
- **Confirmation on the one destructive control.** *End session* closes the pane, so it is gated by a
  Slack confirm dialog that names that consequence. The pane id is resolved from `terminal_id` at
  click time, so a moved pane cannot make it land on a different terminal.
- **Inbound actions are logged** to `daemon.log` as ndjson (user id, action, outcome — never terminal
  content or tokens).
- **Credentials live in the OS keychain** (macOS Keychain, or libsecret on Linux) when one is
  available. `config.json` then contains no secrets at all — only workspace and app identifiers.
  Where no keychain exists, tokens fall back to `config.json`, which the daemon refuses to load
  unless it is 0600. `doctor` tells you which of the two is in use.
- **Nothing reads your clipboard.** Tokens are pasted at an explicit prompt, with terminal echo
  suppressed. Setup may *write* the app manifest to the clipboard; it never polls or reads it.
- **Allowlist is Slack member IDs only.** Handles and display names are rejected — there is no
  `users:read` roster lookup.

### 2. What leaves your machine

Extracted agent responses shown on session cards are **terminal output sent to Slack's servers**,
where it is retained, indexed for search, and — on a corporate workspace — **exportable by workspace
admins**. Piping work agents into an employer's Slack can put source code, `.env` contents, and stray
API keys into an admin-readable store.

This is inherent to using Slack as the transport. It is disclosed at setup and mitigated, not hidden:

- **Redaction** of common secret shapes before anything is sent. Best-effort by nature — it is a
  pattern matcher, not a guarantee. Do not rely on it as your only control.
- **`contentMode`**: `full` (**default** — extracted responses leave the machine) · `summary`
  (status and detected prompts only, no free terminal text — **prefer this on work workspaces**) ·
  `titles`. Every control keeps working at every level.
- Only the latest extracted response and the last 20 Slack-started turns are retained; there is no
  live terminal mirror or transcript upload.
- **`excludePaths`**: working directories whose panes never render into Slack.

## Scope

In scope: authentication/authorization bypass, ref forgery or confusion, redaction bypass, secret
leakage into logs, anything letting a non-allowlisted user reach a terminal.

Out of scope: a workspace admin reading their own workspace's messages (that is Slack's model, see
above); an attacker who already has local access to your machine or your config file.

## Supported versions

Pre-1.0: only the latest release gets fixes.
