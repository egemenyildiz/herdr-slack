/**
 * A transport that renders everything and sends nothing.
 *
 * The whole premise of this project is that terminal output on Slack is
 * retained and admin-exportable, and the honest answer to "what would actually
 * leave my machine?" is to show someone their own herd rendered under their own
 * `contentMode` — before any of it is sent, and before an app exists to send it
 * with. So this decorator sits at the transport boundary, below redaction and
 * `contentMode` filtering, and above the network: what it prints is byte-for-byte
 * what Slack would have received.
 *
 * It never opens a connection, which is what makes `--dry-run` usable as a
 * pre-flight with no tokens at all.
 *
 * ⚠️ Writes return **synthetic but stable ids** rather than empty strings. A
 * `postMessage` that returned `""` would leave the registry with no card ts,
 * and the card's `chat.update` path would never execute — dry-run would then
 * be exercising a code path that production never takes, which is worse than
 * useless because it looks like coverage.
