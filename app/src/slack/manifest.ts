What it is: a self-hosted bridge that lets me answer my own coding agents from
Slack. It runs on my machine only.

Network exposure: none. It uses Slack Socket Mode, an outbound WebSocket — there
is no public URL, no inbound firewall rule, and no third-party server involved.
Nothing is hosted outside Slack and my laptop.

Bot scopes requested:
${scopes}

The app is not distributed and is installed only to this workspace.

Source code, for review:  ${REPO_URL}
Security policy:          ${REPO_URL}/blob/main/SECURITY.md`;
